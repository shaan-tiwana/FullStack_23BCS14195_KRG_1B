## ⚙️ Database Overview

For this project, **MySQL** was chosen as the database system to store metadata for the project files.  
An active **MySQL instance** was already available on an **Oracle Cloud Instance** (used for the *Advanced Database Management Systems* subject), so the same instance was utilized for this project.

## 👤 Database User

A new MySQL user was created specifically for this project:

The credentials for the same are shared via the ByteXL Nimbus (Experiment 6 description) as exposing them here publically poses a security risk. If in any case you do not have access to the byteXL you can whatsapp me directly on +91 9530909017 for credentials.

Database Name is `doc_share_db`

> ⚠️ **Note:** This user account is used **only for project purposes**.

## 🌐 Database Hosting

The database is hosted on: `vm1.shaantiwana.uk` with the name `doc_share_db`

You can connect to it using the above credentials through any MySQL management tool such as **DBeaver**, **DataGrip**, or other similar platforms.
