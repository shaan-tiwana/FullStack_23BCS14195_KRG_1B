## ⚙️ Database Overview

For this project, **MySQL** was chosen as the database system to store metadata for the project files.  
An active **MySQL instance** was already available on an **Oracle Cloud Instance** (used for the *Advanced Database Management Systems* subject), so the same instance was utilized for this project.
